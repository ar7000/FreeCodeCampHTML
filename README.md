# FreeCodeCampHTML

Revisiting HTML via FreeCodeCamp resources and copying passed code to Git repo as I go through each task. Documenting below anything new I learn, or anything I am reminded of that I may have forgotten.

- Learned use of HTML5 <main> tags. Not something I have utilised previously.
- Learned use of internal page links using ID.
- Refreshed memory on HTML forms, including:
    - Inclusion of radio buttons and checkboxes and their related grouping and labelling methods.
    - Setting of a field to be required by the form.
    - Default checking of radio buttons and checkboxes.
